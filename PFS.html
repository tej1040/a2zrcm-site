      The Provider Fee Schedule (PFS) defines how payers such as Medicare, Medicaid, 
      or commercial insurers determine the allowed amount for each CPT/HCPCS code.
      Payments are calculated using components such as RVUs, GPCIs, and the Conversion Factor.
    </p>

    <!-- RVU Explanation -->
    <h3>What Are RVUs?</h3>
    <p>
      The Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS) uses three types of Relative Value Units (RVUs)
      to determine the value of a medical service:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Work RVU (wRVU):</strong> Measures provider effort, time, skill, and intensity.</li>
      <li><strong>Practice Expense RVU (peRVU):</strong> Covers overhead such as staff, rent, and equipment.</li>
      <li><strong>Malpractice RVU (mpRVU):</strong> Represents the cost of liability insurance required to protect providers from legal claims.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Malpractice Explanation -->
    <h3>What Is Malpractice in PFS?</h3>
    <p>
      Malpractice RVU is based on the cost of professional liability insurance. 
      Specialties with higher legal risks (such as surgery or OB-GYN) have higher malpractice RVUs, 
      while low-risk specialties have lower values. This ensures payment aligns with the level of legal exposure.
    </p>

    <!-- GPCI Explanation -->
    <h3>What Is GPCI?</h3>
    <p>
      Geographic Practice Cost Index (GPCI) adjusts RVUs based on cost differences in different locations.
      Each RVU component has its own GPCI:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Work GPCI</li>
      <li>Practice Expense GPCI</li>
      <li>Malpractice GPCI</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      High-cost cities receive higher adjustments, while low-cost regions receive lower ones.
    </p>

    <!-- Conversion Factor Explanation -->
    <h3>What Is the Conversion Factor (CF)?</h3>
    <p>
      The Conversion Factor is a fixed dollar amount updated annually by CMS. 
      It converts total RVUs into the final allowed payment amount.
      For example: <em>1 RVU × CF = Payment</em>.
    </p>

    <!-- Formula -->
    <h3>How Is the Final Allowed Amount Calculated?</h3>
    <p>The Medicare payment formula includes three steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Multiply each RVU by its corresponding GPCI.</li>
      <li>Add the adjusted RVUs to get the Total RVU.</li>
      <li>Multiply the Total RVU by the Conversion Factor (CF).</li>
    </ol>

    <pre>
Final Allowed Amount = (wRVU × wGPCI) 
                     + (peRVU × peGPCI) 
                     + (mpRVU × mpGPCI)
                     × CF
    </pre>

    <!-- Example -->
    <h3>Example Calculation (CPT 99213)</h3>
    <p>Using sample values:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>wRVU: 1.30, PE RVU: 1.00, MP RVU: 0.10</li>
      <li>wGPCI: 1.02, PE GPCI: 1.05, MP GPCI: 0.90</li>
      <li>Conversion Factor (CF): $36.09</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Total Final Allowed Amount = <strong>$88.95</strong></p>

    <!-- Types of Fee Schedules -->
    <h3>Types of Provider Fee Schedules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Medicare Fee Schedule (MFS):</strong> Uses the RBRVS system.</li>
      <li><strong>Medicaid Fee Schedule:</strong> State-specific, generally lower.</li>
      <li><strong>Commercial Fee Schedule:</strong> Negotiated between payer and provider.</li>
      <li><strong>Workers' Compensation Fee Schedule:</strong> Separate state rules.</li>
      <li><strong>Facility vs. Non-Facility PFS:</strong> Payments differ based on where services are performed.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Why We Need PFS -->
    <h3>Why Do We Need a Provider Fee Schedule?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensures standardized payment for services.</li>
      <li>Improves transparency in reimbursement.</li>
      <li>Helps reduce healthcare cost variations.</li>
      <li>Allows RCM teams to detect underpayments.</li>
      <li>Supports contract negotiation for providers.</li>
    </ul>
